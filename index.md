# about me

Hi! I'm Filipe and currently I'm a master student of Teleinformatics Engineering at [UFC](https://ufc.br) in the Teleinformatics Engineering Department [DETI](https://deti.ufc.br). I had previously graduated in Telecommunications Engineering also at DETI. During my bachelor I studied signal processing and focused on the study and applications of Gaussian processes. I'm a physics enthusiast and I'm continuosly learning about it on several topics, but mainly [Statistical Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_39.html). I'm trying to post regurlarly about the topics I'm studying here. Please, feel free to leave any comments in ``filipepfarias AT gmail DOT com``.
